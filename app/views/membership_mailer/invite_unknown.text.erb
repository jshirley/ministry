Lend a hand on <%= @project.name %>
===============================================

One of the project managers of <%= @project.name %> thought you would be the
perfect fit for <%= @role.name %>.

Since you don't already have an account, you'll have to create one. Don't
worry, it should be pretty painless.

  1. Go to <%= @registration_url %>.
  2. Use this email <%= @membership.email %> to create an account (you can change it later).
  3. Accept the invitation (you'll see a message about this).
  4. Do something awesome!

If you don't want to work on this project, simply ignore this email!
